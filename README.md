# Robot Coding Challenge

## Challenge Overview 
This challenge forms part of a developer coding challenge, described [here](/instructions.md)

## My experience / observations 
Are detailed [here](/observations.md)

## Running the game 
Execute `python main.py` from the root folder. The debug logs can be found (once generated), in the `/logs` folder. The logging level should be set to `DEBUG` (if it has been changed) to ensure a detailed level of logs.

## Running the tests 
Execute `pytest` from the `src` folder. Executing it from the root folder will result in errors (due to the relative referencing of the input file)
