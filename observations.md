I originally joined [BJSS]() in the role of Architect having come from a career at [Accenture]() where I was mostly in Technical Delivery Manager position. Whilst having studied Computer Science at University, I have never been in the role of Software Engineer in a professional capacity. As such, please excuse any coding conventions or patterns that don't follow best practice. 

I decided to settle on using Python given that it was a language that I could pick up pretty quickly to get a workable solution. 

Other languages considered were TypeScript and Java. I have employed heavy usage of TypeScript for a [side of desk project](https://www.golfchamps.net) of mine, utilising NestJs and Next.js - however - I am not familiar in setting up Typescript outside of a pre-configured scaffolding app. 

Whilst I would have benefitted from a type safe language, the challenge itself looked relatively simple  to be able to do without the type safety benefits of the languages mentioned above. 

In a typical scenario, where my technical skillset is not being assessed directly, I would have opted to get a solution generated using GenAI LLMs - specifically [Claude Code](https://www.anthropic.com/claude-code), which I have found to be very effective (with strong supervised prompt guidance). 

Another struggle that I have had is finding time, outside of working hours, to complete this challenge. The development of this task has taken over a week, mainly due to the short periods that I've been able to save to progress the task. Cumulatively, this exercise has probably taken me around 4 hours to complete.
